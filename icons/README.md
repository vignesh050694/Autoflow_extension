# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can create simple placeholder icons or use any PNG images with the correct dimensions.

To create placeholder icons quickly, you can use an online tool or create them programmatically.
